# Chinglish Patterns: Chinese Scholar Fix Guide

## Critical Grammar Fixes

### 1. Article Omission

Chinese has no articles. Add `a/an/the` rigorously.

| Wrong (CN) | Right (EN) |
|------------|------------|
| Result shows that... | **The** result shows that... |
| We propose novel approach | We propose **a** novel approach |
| The performance of model | The performance of **the** model |
| In experiment, we found | **In the** experiment, we found |

### 2. Subject-Verb Agreement

CN verbs don't inflect. Check every subject-verb pair.

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| The results **demonstrates** | The results **demonstrate** |
| Each method **have** | Each method **has** |
| Data **was** collected | Data **were** collected (formal convention; "was" also acceptable for collective sense) |
| A set of features **were** | A set of features **was** |

### 3. Plural -s

CN nouns don't mark plurality. Add `-s` / `-es` / `-ies`.

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| several **approach** | several **approaches** |
| one of the **method** | one of the **methods** |
| many **study** | many **studies** |
| few **paper** | few **papers** |

### 4. Tense Consistency

CN has no tense system. Ensure consistent tense usage.

| Scenario | Use |
|----------|-----|
| Describing past literature | Past: `Smith et al. showed...` |
| Describing your method/results | Present/Past both OK but be consistent |
| Stating general truths | Present: `Gradient descent converges when...` |
| In the same paragraph | Stick to ONE tense for the same topic |

## Stylistic Fixes

### 5. Overuse of "can"

CN uses 可以 (can) much more than English academic writing uses "can".

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| This method **can solve** the problem | This method **solves** the problem |
| The model **can achieve** high accuracy | The model **achieves** high accuracy |
| We **can observe** that | We **observe** that (~ or remove entirely) |
| This **can be attributed to** | This **is attributable to** / **stems from** |

### 6. "According to" Overuse

| Instead of "According to [X],..." | Use |
|-----------------------------------|-----|
| According to previous work | As shown by / As reported by / X demonstrated that |
| According to the results | The results indicate / The results reveal |
| According to Table 1 | Table 1 shows / As shown in Table 1 |

### 7. "Make / Let" Constructions

CN 让/使 patterns don't translate to "make" or "let" in academic English.

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| This **makes** the model **to** learn | This **allows** the model **to** learn / This **enables** learning |
| Let X be the input | (This one is OK in math) |
| The function **makes** the error reduce | The function **reduces** the error |
| It **makes us** understand | It **helps us** understand |

### 8. "So" as Conjunction

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| The data was noisy, **so** we filtered it | The data was noisy**; therefore**, we filtered it |
| ..., so the results are significant | ..., **thus** the results are significant |

### 9. Wrong Prepositions

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| different **with** | different **from** (or **than**, US) |
| based **from** | based **on** |
| depends **from** | depends **on** |
| similar **with** | similar **to** |
| compare **with** (when meaning "liken to") | `compare to` = liken; `compare with` = examine differences. Both are correct in their respective senses. |
| consist **with** | consist **of** |
| related **with** | related **to** |
| according **with** | according **to** |
| in **the** other hand | **on** the other hand |

### 10. "Most of" vs "Most"

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| Most of methods | Most methods |
| Most of the methods | (Correct — has determiner "the") |
| Most the methods | Most of the methods |

## Word-Level Fixes

### 11. Commonly Confused Pairs

| CN pattern | Wrong | Right |
|------------|-------|-------|
| 做研究 | make research | **conduct/do** research |
| 做实验 | make experiments | **conduct/run** experiments |
| 做分析 | make an analysis | **perform/conduct** an analysis |
| 扮演角色 | play a role | (Correct! "Plays a role" is fine) |
| 学习知识 | learn knowledge | **acquire/gain** knowledge |
| 很大 | big problem | **major/serious/significant** problem |

### 12. Redundancy from CN Patterns

| CN Phrase | Remove / Replace |
|-----------|-----------------|
| "We try to explore..." | → "We explore..." |
| "in the following part" | → "below" / "in the following" |
| "more and more important" | → "increasingly important" |
| "research field" | → "field" (research is implied) |
| "we should notice that" | → "notably," / delete entirely |
| "plays an important role" | → "contributes to" / "is essential for" (specific, not generic) |
| "has attracted much attention" | → "has been extensively studied" / "has seen rapid progress" |
| "with the development of" | → delete — just say what happened |
| "we firstly..." | → "First, we..." / "We first..." |
| "comparing with" | → "compared with" / "in comparison to" |
| "it is obvious that" | → delete — if obvious, state it without preamble |
| "has a great influence on" | → "substantially affects" / "significantly impacts" |
| "gives a good performance" | → "performs well" / "achieves strong performance" |
| "in order to" | → "to" (almost always shorter and identical in meaning) |
| "a large number of" | → "many" / "numerous" |

### 13. Subject-Verb Inversion in Clauses

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| Only when the model converges, it achieves... | Only when the model converges **does it** achieve... |
| Not only this method is fast, but... | Not only **is** this method fast, but... |
| Figure 2 is shown the results | Figure 2 shows the results / The results are shown in Figure 2 |

### 14. Missing Parallel Structure

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| ...for training, validating, and to test | ...for training, validating, and testing |
| The method is fast, accurate, and it is robust | The method is fast, accurate, and robust |
| We compare A with B, and also C | We compare A with B and C |

## Structural Fixes

### 15. Paragraph Openings

CN essay style opens paragraphs with "First,... Second,...". This pattern is too rigid for English papers.

Instead, use:
- Topic sentence stating the claim
- Supporting evidence/analysis
- Transition to next idea

### 16. Conclusion Phrasing

Don't: "In summary, we have done X, Y, and Z." (this is a list, not a conclusion)
Do: "We have shown that [key finding], enabled by [key mechanism], advancing [broader impact]."

### 17. "Based on" Misuse

"Based on" is overused as a sentence opener when the real relationship is methodological, not foundational.

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| Based on the observation that X, we propose Y | Motivated by the observation that X, we propose Y |
| Based on this, we conclude... | We therefore conclude... / These results suggest... |
| The method is based on transformer | The method uses a transformer / builds on a transformer |
| Based on our analysis | Our analysis shows / We find that |

### 18. Redundant "the" with Abstract Nouns

CN speakers often add "the" before abstract or uncountable nouns where English omits it.

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| the research on NLP | research on NLP |
| the evidence suggests | evidence suggests (or: the evidence, if referring to specific evidence just introduced) |
| in the practice | in practice |
| in the nature | in nature |
| the society | society (general); the society (specific organization) |

## Quick-Fix Checklist

1. Every singular countable noun has `a/an/the`
2. Every verb agrees with its subject
3. Past tense for literature, consistent tense within sections
4. No unsupported "can"
5. No "according to" without specific source
6. Prepositions are correct (use list above)
7. No "make sb. to do" constructions
8. No sentence-initial "So"
9. Redundancy words removed (research field → field, in order to → to, etc.)
10. No 1→2→3 rigid paragraph structure
11. "Based on" not overused as sentence opener
12. No redundant "the" before abstract nouns
